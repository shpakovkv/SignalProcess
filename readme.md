SignalProcess project
=====================

The program is intended for initial processing of experimental data (digital signals of detectors).


### Key features:

* easy reading data from WFM binary files and text files like CSV, DAT, TXT, etc.
* multiplying by the specified multiplier and subtracting the specified time delay independently for each curve
* alignment of the time origin on the front edge of the selected curve (binding)
* automatic subtraction of a constant component from the amplitude of selected signals (zero level correction)
* search of peaks with flexible adjustment of search parameters
* automatic grouping of peaks (from different signals), coinciding (with the specified tolerance) in time
* plotting of graphs with peaks and without
